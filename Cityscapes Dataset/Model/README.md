Cityscapes data (dataset home page) contains labeled videos taken from vehicles driven in Germany. This version is a processed subsample created as part of the Pix2Pix paper. The dataset has still images from the original videos, and the semantic segmentation labels are shown in images alongside the original image. This is one of the best datasets around for semantic segmentation tasks.

GOAL Implementtion of algorithm like tensorflow keras for classification.

DESCRIPTION

The main aim of the project is to make a model that helps to predict CityScapes on the given dataset.

WORK DONE

Balacing the dataset and defining keras Model with UNet. Then evaluating the images of dataset.

LIBRARIES NEEDED

Pandas  
Numpy   
OS  
Tenserflow


OUTPUT: Evaluated images

CONCLUSION

We created a model which predict the . The model gives an accuracy score of the comments on the dataset.

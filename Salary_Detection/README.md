5. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - On macOS and Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
6. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
7. Run the Flask application: `python app.py`
8. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the application.

## Usage
- Once the Flask application is running, you can use the web interface to input data for predicting salaries of data professionals.

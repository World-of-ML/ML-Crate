**DESCRIPTION**



**WHAT HAVE I DONE**

- Removed stopwords, punctuations, made text lowercase, and lemmatized text to base form.
- Made WordClouds for:
    - The entire dataset
    - Words featured in positive sentiments
    - Words featured in negative sentiments
- Vectorized text using TF-IDF vectorizer
- Applied classification on a dataset with:
    - Parameter: TF-IDF vectors
    - Label: Encoded sentiment

Classification algorithms like:
- Logistic regression
- Naive-Bayes classifier
- SVM classifier
- Random Forest Regressor

**LIBRARIES NEEDED**

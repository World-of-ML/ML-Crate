**WHAT I HAD DONE**

* Checked for first dataset values out of 7537 datasets.
* Checked for missing values and cleaned the data accordingly.
* Analyzed the data, found insights and visualized them accordingly.
* Found detailed insights of different columns with target variable using plotting libraries.
* Train the datasets by different models and saves their accuracies into a dataframe.


**LIBRARIES NEEDED**

1. Pandas
2. Plotly
3. Sklearn
4. NumPy
5. XGBoost
6. Tensorflow
7. Keras


**CONCLUSION**

- Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regression Models are best fitted to the datasets.
- Accuracy achieved is around 99.5 %.
- LSTM Model also perfoms well on the datasets as their MSE and R2 scores are very much good.

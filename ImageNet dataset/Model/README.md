ImageNet Dataset 

While It's pretty easy for people to identify subtle differences in photos, computers still have a ways to go. Visually similar items are tough for computers to count, like this overlapping bunch of bananas:

DESCRIPTION

To solve this problem and enhance the state of the art in object detection and classification

WORK DONE

There’s been a 4.2× reduction in image classification error (from 28.2% to 6.7%) and a 1.7× reduction in localization error (from 42.5% to 25.3%) between 2010 and 2020 alone.

CONCLUSION

So we have successfully created the model to classify the blur images.

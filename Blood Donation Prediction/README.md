# Blood Donation Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a predictive model that can accurately identify donors likely to donate blood again. The dataset used for this analysis is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mmmarchetti/predicting-blood-donations).

## Dataset

- **Dataset Link:** [Blood Donation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mmmarchetti/predicting-blood-donations)
- **Attributes:**
  - Recency (months)
  - Frequency (times)
  - Monetary (c.c. blood)
  - Time (months)

## Approach

1. **Data Understanding and Exploration:**
   - Load and explore the dataset.
   - Check for missing values, outliers, and data types.
   - Visualize the distribution of each feature and the target variable.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values.
   - Encode categorical variables if needed.
   - Scale or normalize numerical features.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

3. **Model Selection and Training:**
   - Implement various machine learning models and deep learning methods.
   - Train each model on the training dataset.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate each model's performance using metrics like accuracy, ROC AUC, and classification reports.
   - Utilize cross-validation for robust performance assessment.

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Optimize hyperparameters for selected models to improve performance.
   - Use techniques like grid search or randomized search.

6. **Model Comparison:**
   - Compare the performance of different models and identify the most effective ones.

7. **Deep Learning:**
   - Implement at least one or two deep learning models using TensorFlow/Keras.
   - Train and evaluate the deep learning models.

8. **Final Model and Conclusion:**
   - Select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
   - Summarize the findings and draw conclusions about predictors of blood donation.

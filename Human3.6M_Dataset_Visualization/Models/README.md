# Human3.6M Dataset Visualization

### 🎯 Goal
The main goal of this project is to visualize the Human3.6M dataset to better understand human poses and movements captured in various scenarios.

### 🧵 Dataset
The dataset used for this visualization can be accessed [here](http://vision.imar.ro/human3.6m/description.php). It includes extensive data of human activities captured in a controlled environment.

### 🧾 Description
This project involves an in-depth visualization of the Human3.6M dataset, which consists of 3D human poses and motions. The visualizations help in understanding the complex movements and postures of the human body in different actions.

### 🧮 What I had done!
1. Collected and pre-processed the dataset.
2. Performed exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns and trends in human movements.
3. Implemented various visualization techniques to represent the 3D poses and motions.
4. Visualized the data using charts and 3D plots to better understand the insights.
5. Analyzed the visualizations to gain insights into human motion dynamics.

### 🚀 Visualizations Implemented
- 3D Scatter Plots: To visualize the spatial positions of body joints.
- Motion Trajectories: For visualizing the paths of body joints over time.
- Heatmaps: To represent the frequency of joint positions.

### 📚 Libraries Needed
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis Results

### 📈 Insights from the Visualizations
- The 3D scatter plots effectively depict the spatial relationships between different body joints.
- Motion trajectories provide a clear view of joint movements over time.
- Heatmaps highlight the most frequent joint positions, indicating common postures.

### 📢 Conclusion
The visualizations provided significant insights into human poses and movements. These insights can be useful for various applications, including motion capture analysis, human-computer interaction, and biomechanics research.

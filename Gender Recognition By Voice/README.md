**WHAT I HAD DONE**

* Load the dataset which contains 5993 entries in it and having 22 columns in it.
* Checked for missing values and cleaned the data accordingly.
* Analyzed the data, found insights and visualized them accordingly.
* Plotting heatmap using correlation and checking the relation between different features.
* Found detailed insights of different columns with target variable using plotting libraries.
* Train the datasets by different models and saves their accuracies into a dataframe.


**LIBRARIES NEEDED**

1. Pandas
2. Matplotlib
3. Sklearn
4. NumPy
5. XGBoost
6. Tensorflow
7. Keras
8. Sci-py
9. Seaborn


**CONCLUSION**

- Gradient Boosting Regression and Random Forest Regression Models are best fitted to the datasets.
- MSE and R2 score of both models are very much good compare to other models.
- The visualization graph also best fitted to the dataset on Gradient Boosting Regression Model.

-  The contest was not held in the year 2020 as is evident from the "Total Points scored over the years" plot.
-   The graph also tells that the total points scored over the years have increased significantly with being less than 100 before 1970 and well over 400 after 2010.
- Ireland had the honor of hosting the Eurovision contest most number of times between 1956 and 2022.

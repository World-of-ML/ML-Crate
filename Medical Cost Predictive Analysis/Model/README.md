# Medical Cost Prediction

## Goal

The main goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the medical charges of a person based on the given features. The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the evaluation set. The model with the highest accuracy is selected as the best performing model for this task. The model was developed using the scikit-learn library also xgboost, and catboost libraries are used for this task. The model was evaluated using appropriate metrics such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, root mean squared error, and R2 score.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project can be found at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance) and [GitHub](https://github.com/stedy/Machine-Learning-with-R-datasets).

For more information about the dataset, please refer to this readme file in the Dataset folder [Dataset Description](../Dataset/README.md)

## Approach

1. **Data loading and exploration:** Loaded the dataset, explored the dataset using pandas profiling, and performed exploratory data analysis. In EDA, I have used different plots to visualize the relationship between the features and the target variable and the relationship between the features. such as box plot, scatter plot, histogram etc.

2. **Data preprocessing:** Performed data preprocessing steps such as feature scaling, encoding, and feature selection. For feature scaling, I have used the StandardScaler from the scikit-learn library. For encoding, I have used the OrdinalEncoder from the scikit-learn library. Also, dataset is split into training and evaluation sets.

3. **Model development(Top 3):** Developed multiple models using the scikit-learn library. Top three models are:

```bash
a. Gradient Boosting Regressor:

- Description: Gradient Boosting Regressor is a boosting ensemble algorithm that builds the model in a stage-wise fashion, optimizing an arbitrary differentiable loss function.
- Accuracy: 87.7973%
```

```bash

b. CatBoosting Regressor:

- Description: CatBoosting Regressor is a boosting ensemble algorithm similar to Gradient Boosting Regressor.
- Accuracy: 86.8598%
```

```bash
c. Random Forest Regressor:

- Description: Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble learning method for regression that constructs multiple decision trees and outputs the mean prediction of the individual trees.
- Accuracy: 86.4436%
```

4. **Model evaluation:** Evaluated the performance of each model using appropriate metrics such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, root mean squared error, and R2 score. The model with the highest accuracy on evaluation is selected as the best performing model for this task.
